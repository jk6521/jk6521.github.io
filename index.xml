Having a /home partition comes with a lot of advantages but what I like is
Keep your personal files in separate partition If you want to switch distro you don&amp;rsquo;t need to format all your partitions, move every files instead just don&amp;rsquo;t partition the /home one and all linux can use /home partition Your configuration stays the same, you are just switching distro or doing fresh installation again.</description></item></channel></rss>
